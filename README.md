# ASM proj

This school project was created for the [ASM (Analiza Socijalnih Mreza, en. Social Network Analysis) course][asm], 
which is part of the Master studies at the [School of Electrical Engineering][school], [University of Belgrade][uni].

This project consisted of modeling three distinct networks (actor, genre and movie networks) from an IMDb dataset of the top 1000 most popular movies, and then applying social network analysis methods in order to answer some pre-defined research questions. The whole project was realized as a Python script with the usage of NetworkX and matplotlib libraries.

The project statement in Serbian is given in [ASM_PZ2_1819.pdf][statement].

The results of the project are contained in the [ASM Projekat - Izvestaj.pdf][report] report (also in Serbian).
